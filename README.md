Your website looks fun and creative, and the hamster hotel theme is very clear. The layout is clean, and the navigation bar works well on both desktop and mobile. The images match the content nicely and make the page visually appealing. The sections are organized in a logical order, so it’s easy to follow. One suggestion is to check image file paths—some use /assets/... while others use assets/..., which might break images depending on the folder structure. Overall, it’s a well-designed and enjoyable site to browse.
